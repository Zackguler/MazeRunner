Story
The player who tries to escape from the enemies enters a maze and disappears. A difficult journey
awaits player in the labyrinth he/she enters. The only way out is to complete the level by
overcoming the obstacles in the labyrinth and collecting the coins that are their task. When it
reaches the destination, everything returns to normal and succeeds.
Manual Options

The player can control the character with W, A, S and D keys.
W: Makes the character move forward.
A: Makes the character turn left. (In terms of camera)
S: Makes the character move back.
D: Makes the character turn right. (In terms of camera)
Space: It allows the character to jump.
The player's goal is to successfully complete both levels. It must avoid overcoming obstacles and
avoid bullets hitting the turrets. Because each bullet takes 5 lives from the life of the player, they
have 100 lives in total. Besides, it is necessary to pay attention to the duration and complete the
level by collecting all the coins (2 coins in the first part, 3 coins in the second part) before it is full.
